/* P.S. My Actual solution at the first was a mess since I've used Python before and didn't know there was a nextInt syntax.
I usually take the whole series of numbers in a lines like "1 2 12 123" as a string and then use split to extract the actual numbers in Python (I don't know if there's a better way). 
So I used it the first time in Java as well. It's really embaressing, but I'll put it is here as well:*/
